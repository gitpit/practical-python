Why learning python seems so straightforward. Is this becuase I already know C based languages or is it the way python language is?

What about writing a very large application like simulation? What about integrating with OS based frameworks? What about rich UI design?

What about design patterns in python? 

Is there a proven application like C++, .Net in python which exists?
