Why learning python seems so straightforward. Is this becuase I already know C based languages or is it the way python language is?
I still wonder that till now, things have been quite simple and when I start writing long complex programs I may realize the issues.
What about writing a very large application like simulation? What about integrating with OS based frameworks? What about rich UI design?
What about platform SDK integration? What about code management? 
What about design patterns in python? 
What about working on a single file with other team members?
Is there a proven application like C++, .Net in python which exists?
