# default arguments
# If no return value is given or return is missing, None is returned.
# multiple reutrn value as tuple

#note:: function can't modify global variable outside
# to modify a global vairbale it has to prefix with global keyword inside its scope
name = 'Dave'
def spam():
    global name
    name = 'Guido' # Changes the global name above

# argument passing - pass by value ; pass by ref
## Key point: Functions donâ€™t receive a copy of the input arguments.
## Reminder: Variable assignment never overwrites memory. The name is merely bound to a new value.
