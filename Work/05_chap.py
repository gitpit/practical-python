#####  5.1 Dictionaries Revisited
'''
Dicts and Modules
Within a module, a dictionary holds all of the global variables and functions.
'''
#import meslog
import sys
import os

excdir = os.getcwd()
excdir += r'\work'
sys.path
sys.path.append(excdir)
import Work.meslog as meslog

xs =meslog.TSec(1,2,3,4)
xs.__dict__

'''
### Dicts and Objects
User defined objects also use dictionaries for both instance data and classes. In fact, the entire object system is mostly 
an extra layer thatâ€™s put on top of dictionaries.

A dictionary holds the instance data, __dict__.
'''
import stock

s1 = stock.Stock('gg',12,45)

s1.__dict__
