Python requirements files are a great way to keep track of the Python modules. It is a simple text file that saves a list of the modules and packages required by your project. By creating a Python requirements.txt file, you save yourself the hassle of having to track down and install all of the required modules manually.


    pip list --outdated    #check outdated version first
    pip install -U <packagename>
    pip freeze > requirements.txt  #to create and update the Python requirements file.
    pip install -U -r requirements.txt  #It is also possible to upgrade everything with 
    python -m pip check    #check for missing dependencies
    pip check  #always do to check any broken lib in requirment
